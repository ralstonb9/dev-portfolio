# dev-portfolio

## Description
In this weeks challenge I was tasked with creating a professional developer portfolio. For this challenge I was not given any starter code and was told to create a webpage with a picture and information about myself and previous projects I have worked on. I also needed to include a navbar with functioning links to the different sections on our page and pictures of our projects with links to the deployed pages.
